# Todo CLI tool
    As per my requirements I have thought of making a CLI Todo app where it will have these functions as of now 


    -> enter the git repo 
    -> connection success or fail check for the correct auth
    -> Add day no
    -> add task 
    -> save or exit command 
    -> Changes pushed to repo
    -> Scheduler 
    -> 

     git script
    {
        git add 
        git commit " File_name "
        All The Pushing Cmd for git repository
    }

# Requirements for me right now 
    
    [Done]Coding basic Functional things 
        - Create Task
        - add Task 
        - delete Task
    [Up] Scheduler for Git Push

# Functionalities I have thought 

   -  Task creation and management: 
        Create, edit, and delete tasks.
   -  Task organization: Organize tasks into lists or categories.
   -  Task prioritization: Set priority levels for tasks.
   -  Due dates: Set due dates for tasks.
   - Reminders: Set reminders for tasks.
   - Completion tracking: Mark tasks as completed.
